First run correct the grammer ${the given sentence}

If their are words the do not add value to the sentence or unecesary
mark them remove : true

Also make sure tha there is not unecesary space between the words
For Example `Hellow  there` there is two unecesary spaces instaed
of one so mark there as incorrect and add the proper spacing like
{" there" : {status : 'incorrect', correction : 'there'}, remove : false}},

# Explanation

unecesary

# Example One

## Example Input Text:

"She are a good students"

## Desired Output Format:

"original_text" : "She are a good students hellow",
"corrected" : [
{"She" : {status : 'correct', correction : null, remove : false}},
{"are" : {status : 'incorrect', correction : 'is', remove : false}},
{" a" : {status : 'incorrect', correction : 'a'}, remove : false}},
{"good" : {status : 'correct', correction : null, remove : false}},
{"students" : {status : 'incorrect', correction : 'student.', remove : false}},
{"hellow" : {status : 'incorrect', correction : null, remove : true}},
]

# Explanation

From the above sentence " a" is incorrect because of unecesary space at the beging of the word
From the above sentence "hellow" was marked as remove : true because it does't add value

I have an API the accepts a JSON and returns a JSON

## Sample Input

{
'sentence' : "When I grow up, I start to understand what he said is quite right."
}

## Sample Output

{
'original' : "When I grow up, I start to understand what he said is quite right.",
'corrected' : "When I grow up, I begin to understand that what he said is quite right."
}

give me a javascript code make the original sentence in the textarea 
and highlight the grammer errors compared to the corrected and when I click
on the highlight a pop up will open and shows me the correct word or phrase
and when i click on the correct word or phrase the wrong word or the wrong
phrase will be removed from the original inside the textarea
